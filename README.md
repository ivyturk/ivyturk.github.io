I am a PhD student at the Department of Computer Science and Technology at the University of Cambridge studying interactions between technology and domestic abuse. This follows two main paths: making it safer for victim-survivors to access support, and creating/improving technical interventions for specific abuses of technology. I am supervised by Alice Hutchings, and part of the Cambridge Cybercrime Centre.
